Product Desription:
  Have you ever wanted to look like Iron Man, but you live in Canada? Buddy, do we have
  the product for you! The Screamathon 3300 is a heated glove with the added benefit of
  passing snarky remarks at you through the on-board LCD display. But, there's a catch...
  The only way to survive the horrorific chill of the Canadian winter is to SCREAM ON!
  
  Every time that I look in the mirror
  All these lines on my face getting clearer
  The past is gone
  Oh, it went by like dusk to dawn
  Isn't that the way?
  Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, oh, oh, oh
  I know nobody knows
  Where it comes and where it goes
  I know it's everybody's sin
  You got to lose to know how to win
  Half my life's in books' written pages
  Storing facts learned from fools and from sages
  You view the earth
  Oh, sing with me, this mournful dub
  Sing with me, sing for a year
  Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
  Sing with me, if it's just for today
  Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
  Oh, sing with me, sing for the year
  Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear
  Sing it with me, if it's just for today
  Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
  SCREAM ON 
  SCREAM ON
  I SCREAM ON
  SCREAM a little, I'll SCREAM ON
  SCREAM ON
  I SCREAM ON
  I SCREAM ON
  SCREAM a little, I'll SCREAM ON
  SCREAM ON
  SCREAM ON
  SCREAM ON
  I'll SCREAM ON
  SCREAM ON
  SCREAM ON
  I SCREAM ON
